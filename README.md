# MCRcon

Just a quick bot used to manage a few of the modded minecraft servers I'm hosting.
This bot is designed to be used in _multiple different discord servers/guilds_, with separate configs per server/guild.

## TODOs:

- Add template database file to repository so bot can actually function
- Add documentation and setup example
- Strip out references to personal servers
